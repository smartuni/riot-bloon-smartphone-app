This app was developed as part of a project by ![RIOT OS](https://www.riot-os.org) with the objective of releasing a balloon which can tell us information regarding the weather in its surroundings like humidity, temperature, and air pressure. The information we fetch is in a Firebase Realtime Database.  
The sole purpose of the app is to present this information in a simple and appealing manner to the user among other features:

## Features

* Access real-time information about the surroundings of the balloons
* Visualize the balloons geographically in the google maps widget
* Pick a different cluster of balloons to change the source of information to display
* Access a chart regarding the development of the different aspects of the balloons
